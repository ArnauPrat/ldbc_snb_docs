\section{Scale Factor Statistics for the Interactive workload}\label{appendix:scale_factors}

\autoref{table:freqs_sf1} shows the frequencies for each complex query and SF used in the Interactive workload (\autoref{section:interactive}). Note that SF0.1 and SF0.3 are omitted, as they did not exist when the Interactive workload was designed, and are primarily intended to use for testing the BI workload.\todo{Should we define frequencies for SF0.1 and SF0.3?}
