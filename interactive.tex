\chapter{Interactive Workload}
\label{sec:interactive}

This workload consists of a set of relatively complex read-only queries, that touch a significant
amount of data -- often the two-step friendship neighbourhood and associated messages --, but typically in close proximity to a single node. Hence, the query complexity is sublinear to the dataset size.

The LDBC SNB Interactive workload consists of three query classes:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Complex read-only queries.} See \autoref{sec:interactive-complex-reads}.
\item \textbf{Short read-only queries.} See \autoref{sec:interactive-short-reads}.
\item \textbf{Transactional update queries inserting new entities.} See \autoref{sec:interactive-inserts}.
\end{itemize}

A detailed description of the workload (covering reads and inserts) is available in the paper published at \mbox{SIGMOD} 2015~\cite{DBLP:conf/sigmod/ErlingALCGPPB15}.

\section{Inserts (Formerly: Updates)}
\label{sec:interactive-inserts}

Each insert query inserts

\begin{enumerate}
    \item either a single node of a certain type, along with its edges to other existing nodes
    \item or a single edge of a certain type between two existing nodes.
\end{enumerate}
In versions 0.3.x, these operations were called ``Interactive updates''.
From 0.4.0 onwards, these are called ``Interactive inserts''.
