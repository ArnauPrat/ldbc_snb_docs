\chapter{Interactive Workload}
\label{sec:interactive}

This workload consists of a set of relatively complex read-only queries, that touch a significant
amount of data -- often the two-step friendship neighbourhood and associated messages --, but typically in close proximity to a single node. Hence, the query complexity is sublinear to the dataset size.

The LDBC SNB Interactive workload consists of three query classes:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Complex read-only queries.} See \autoref{sec:interactive-complex-reads}.
\item \textbf{Short read-only queries.} See \autoref{sec:interactive-short-reads}.
\item \textbf{Insert operations.} See \autoref{sec:interactive-insert-operations}.
\item \textbf{(new) Delete operations.} See \autoref{sec:interactive-delete-operations}.
\end{itemize}

A detailed description of the workload (covering reads and inserts) is available in the paper published at \mbox{SIGMOD} 2015~\cite{DBLP:conf/sigmod/ErlingALCGPPB15}. The ACID Test Suite was first published at TPCTC 2020~\cite{DBLP:conf/tpctc/WaudbySKMBS20}.
