\chapter{ACID Tests}
\label{sec:acid}

As part of the auditing process, the auditors ascertain that the SUT satisfies ``the ACID properties'', \ie it provides atomic transactions, complies with its claimed isolation level, and ensures durability in case of failures.

\emph{An initial version of the LDBC ACID test suite was recently accepted at the TPCTC~2020 conference~\cite{tpctc_acid}. This will be included in this specification soon.}
