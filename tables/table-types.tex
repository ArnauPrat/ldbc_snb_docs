        Date &  date with a precision of a day, encoded as a string with the following format: \texttt{yyyy-mm-dd}, where \texttt{yyyy} is a four-digit integer representing the year,
        the year, \texttt{mm} is a two-digit integer representing the month and \texttt{dd} is a two-digit integer representing the day. \\

        DateTime &  date with a precision of milliseconds, encoded as a string with the following format: \texttt{yyyy-mm-ddTHH:MM:ss.sss+00:00}, where \texttt{yyyy} is a four-digit integer representing the year,
        the year, \texttt{mm} is a two-digit integer representing the month and \texttt{dd} is a two-digit integer representing the day, \texttt{HH} is a two-digit integer representing the hour, \texttt{MM} is a two
        digit integer representing the minute and \texttt{ss.sss} is a five digit fixed point real number representing the seconds up to millisecond precision. Finally, the \texttt{+00:00} of the end represents the
