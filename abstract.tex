LDBC's Social Network Benchmark (\ldbcsnb) is an effort intended to test
various functionalities of systems used for graph-like data management. For this,
\ldbcsnb uses the recognizable scenario of operating a social network, characterized by
its graph-shaped data.

\ldbcsnb consists of two workloads that focus on different
functionalities: the Interactive workload (interactive transactional queries)
and the Business Intelligence workload (analytical queries). 

This document contains the definition of both workloads. This includes a detailed
explanation of the data used in the \ldbcsnb benchmark, a detailed description
for all queries, and instructions on how to generate the data and run the
benchmark with the provided software.
