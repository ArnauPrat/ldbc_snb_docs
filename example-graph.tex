\chapter{Example graph}
\label{sec:example-graph}

\autoref{fig:example-graph-without-updates} shows a static snapshot of an example graph, while \autoref{fig:example-graph-with-updates} shows an example graph with update operations.
Insertions are denoted with a green asterisk~\includegraphics[scale=0.25]{patterns/insert}.
Deletions of a single element are denoted with a red cross~\includegraphics[scale=0.25]{patterns/delete-single},
while recursive deletions are denoted with a purple cross~\includegraphics[scale=0.25]{patterns/delete-recursively}.
