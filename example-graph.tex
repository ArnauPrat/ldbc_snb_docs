\chapter{Example graph}
\label{sec:example-graph}

\autoref{fig:example-graph-without-refreshes} shows a snapshot of an example graph.

\autoref{fig:example-graph-with-refreshes} shows an example graph with refresh operations. Deletions of a single element (node or edge) are denoted with a red cross \includegraphics[scale=0.14]{patterns/delete-single}, while recursive deletions are denoted with a purple cross \includegraphics[scale=0.14]{patterns/delete-recursively}.
