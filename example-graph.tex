\autoref{fig:example-graph-without-refreshes} shows a snapshot of an example graph.

\autoref{fig:example-graph-with-refreshes} shows an example graph with refresh operations.
Insertions are denoted with a green asterisk~\includegraphics[scale=0.25]{patterns/insert}.
Deletions of a single element are denoted with a red cross~\includegraphics[scale=0.25]{patterns/delete-single},
