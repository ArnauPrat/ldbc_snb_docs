description: |
  For a given `$country`, count all the distinct triples of *Persons* such that:

  * `personA` is friend of `personB`,
  * `personB` is friend of `personC`,
  * `personC` is friend of `personA`,

  and these friendships were created in the range `[$startDate, $endDate]`.

  Distinct means that given a triple $t_1$ in the result set $R$ of all qualified triples, there is no triple $t_2$ in $R$ such that $t_1$ and $t_2$ have the same set of elements.
