title: Interaction path between cities
description: |
  Given two *Cities* with IDs `$city1Id`, `$city2Id`, find *Persons* `person1`, `person2` living in these *Cities* (respectively) with the shortest **interaction path** between them.
  If there are multiple pairs of people with shortest paths with the same total weight, return all of them.

  The shortest path is computed on the *Person-knows-Person* graph based on the number of interactions,
  i.e. the number of direct reply *Comments* from one *Person* to *Messages* by the other *Person*.
  Only *knows* edges with at least one interaction between their endpoint *Persons* are considered.
  The weight of a *knows* edge is defined as:
  $\max(\mathrm{round}( 40 - \sqrt{\textit{numInteractions}} ), 1)$

  **Note:** Interactions are counted both ways, e.g. if Alice *knows* Bob, Alice writes 2 reply *Comments* to Bob's *Messages*
  and Bob writes 3 reply *Comments* to Alice's *Messages*, their total number of interactions is 5 and the weight of the knows edge is 0.2.

  **Remark:** Determinism is ensured by using square root followed by rounding.
  For all integers between 1 and 100000, the square root's fractional part is more than 10e-5 from 0.5, where the rounding could be non-determinstic based on floating point inaccuracies. As 10e-5 is significantly larger than the machine epsilon of IEEE 754 floats (both 32- and 64-bit), the floating point inaccuracies have no chance to affect the derived integer edge weights.

  To find the weighted shortest paths efficiently, the system can use e.g. a bidirectional Dijkstra algorithm.
  As the edge weights do not depend on any parameter, systems can pre-compute them (if they do not interleave reads and writes).
# import math
# for i in range(1, 100000):
#     sq = math.sqrt(i)
#     diff = abs(abs(sq - math.floor(sq)) - 0.5)
#     if diff < 0.00001:
#         print(f"{i}: {diff:.8f}")
