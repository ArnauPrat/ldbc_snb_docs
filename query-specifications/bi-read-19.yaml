title: Interaction path between cities
description: |
  Given two *Cities* `city1`, `city2`, find *Persons* `person1`, `person2` living in these *Cities* (respectively) with the shortest **interaction path** between them.

  The shortest path is computed using a weight between two *Persons* defined as the reciprocal of the number of interactions (direct reply *Comments* to a *Message* by the other *Person*). Therefore, more interactions imply a smaller weight.
parameters:
  - name: city1Id
    type: ID
  - name: city2Id
    type: ID
result:
  - name: person1.id
    type: ID
  - name: person2.id
    type: ID
  - name: weight
    type: 32-bit Float
    category: calculated
sort:
  - name: weight
    direction: desc
  - name: person1.id
    direction: asc
    description: The order of paths with the same weight is unspecified
