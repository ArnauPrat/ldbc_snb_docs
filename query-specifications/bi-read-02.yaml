  Find the *Tags* under a given *TagClass* that were used in *Messages* during in the 100-day period starting at `date` and compare it with the 100-day period that follows.
  For the *Tags* and for both months, compute the count of *Messages*.
parameters:
  - name: date
    type: Date
    description: |
      Based on the date -- *TagClass* -- number of *Messages* factor table:

      `(A)` A flashmob date

      `(B)` A non-flashmob date
  - name: tagClass
    type: Long String
    description: |
      For both `(A)` and `(B)`, *TagClasses* with a similar amount of *Messages* are selected
result:
  - name: tag.name
    type: Long String
  - name: countWindow1
