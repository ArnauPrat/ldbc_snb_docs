  Given a *Person* (`startPerson`), find all other *Persons* (`expertCandidatePerson`) that live in a given *Country* and are connected to given *Person* by a **shortest path** with length in range `[minPathDistance, maxPathDistance]` through the *knows* relation.

  For each of these `expertCandidatePerson` nodes, retrieve all of their *Messages* that contain at least one *Tag* belonging to a given *TagClass* (direct relation not transitive). For each *Message*, retrieve all of its *Tags*.

  Group the results by *Persons* and *Tags*, then count the *Messages* by a certain *Person* having a certain *Tag*.
parameters:
  - name: personId

      `(A)` *Persons* with an average degree of *knows* edges are selected
