title: How many persons have a given number of messages
description: |
  For each *Person*, count the number of *Messages* they made (`messageCount`). Only count *Messages* with the following attributes:

  * Its `content` is not empty (and consequently, the `imageFile` attribute is empty for *Posts*).
  * Its `length` is below the `lengthThreshold` (exclusive, equality is not allowed).
  * Its `creationDate` is after `date` (exclusive, equality is not allowed).
  * It is written in any of the given `languages`.

      * The language of a *Post* is defined by its `language` attribute.
      * The language of a *Comment* is that of the *Post* that initiates the thread where the *Comment* replies to.

      The *Post* and *Comments* in the reply tree's path (from the *Message* to the *Post*) do not have to satisfy the constraints for `content`, `length` and `creationDate`.

  For each `messageCount` value, count the number of *Persons* with exactly `messageCount` *Messages* (with the required attributes).
