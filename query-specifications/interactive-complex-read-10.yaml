description: |
  Given a start *Person* with id `personId`, find that *Person*'s friends of friends (`person`) -- excluding the start *Person* and his/her immediate friends --, who were born on or after the 21st of a given `month` (in any year) and before the 22nd of the following month. Calculate the similarity between each `person` and the start *Person*, where `commonInterestScore` is defined as follows:

  * `common`   = number of *Posts* created by `person`, such that the *Post* has a  *Tag* that the start *Person*, is interested in
  * `uncommon` = number of *Posts* created by `person`, such that the *Post* has no *Tag* that the start *Person*, is interested in
  * `commonInterestScore` = `common` - `uncommon`

  This query looks for paths of length two, starting from a *Person* and ending at the friends of their friends. It does widely scattered graph traversal, and one expects no locality of in friends of friends, as these have been acquired over a long time and have widely scattered identifiers. The join order is simple but one must see that the anti-join for "not in my friends" is better with hash. Also the last pattern in the scalar sub-queries joining or anti-joining the *Tags* of the candidate's *Posts* to interests of self should be by hash.
