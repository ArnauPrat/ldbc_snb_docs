  Given a start *Person*, find *Persons* with a given first name (`firstName`) that the start *Person* is connected to (excluding start *Person*) by at most 3 steps via the *knows* relationships.

  This query is a representative of a simple navigational query. It looks for paths of length 1..3 through the knows relation, starting from a given *Person* and ending at a *Person* with a given first name. It is interesting for several aspects.
  (1) It requires for a complex aggregation for returning the concatenation of universities, companies, languages and email information of the *Person*.
  (2) It tests the ability of the optimizer to move the evaluation of sub-queries functionally dependant on the *Person*, after the evaluation of the top-k.
  (3) Its performance is highly sensitive to properly estimating the cardinalities in each transitive path, and paying attention not to explore already visited *Persons*.
