title: Most authoritative users on a given topic
description: |
  Given a *Tag* (`tag`), find all *Persons* (`person1`) that ever created a *Message* with the *Tag*.
  For each of these *Persons* (`person1`) compute their "authority score" as follows\:

  * The "authority score" is the sum of "popularity scores" of the *Persons* (`person2`) that liked any of that *Person*'s *Messages* with the given *Tag* (same criterion as for `message1`).
  * A *Person*'s (`person2`) "popularity score" is defined as the total number of likes (by any *Person* `person3`) on all of their *Messages* (`message2`).
parameters:
  - name: tag
    type: Long String
    description: |
      *Tags* with a similar amount of *Messages* are selected.
      To avoid caching, different *Tags* should be used than the ones in Q5 and Q7.

  Computing the authority scores might involve computing the popularity score for the same *Person* multiple times. Implementations are advised to avoid such redundant computations.
