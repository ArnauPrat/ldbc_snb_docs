  Get each *Person* (`person`) who has created a *Message* (`message`) with a given *Tag* (direct relation, not transitive). Considering only these *Messages*, for each *Person*\ node:

  * Count its *Messages* (`messageCount`).
  * Count *likes* (`likeCount`) to its *Messages*.
  * Count *Comments* (`replyCount`) in reply to its *Messages*.

  The `score` is calculated according to the following formula: $1 \times \texttt{messageCount} + 2 \times \texttt{replyCount} + 10 \times \texttt{likeCount}$.
parameters:
  - name: tag
    type: Long String

      *Tags* with a similar amount of *Messages* are selected.
      To avoid caching, different *Tags* should be used than the ones in Q6 and Q7.
