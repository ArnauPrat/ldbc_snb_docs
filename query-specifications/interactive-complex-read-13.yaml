title: Single shortest path
description: |
  Given two *Persons* with IDs `$person1Id` and `$person2Id`, find the shortest path between these two *Persons* in the subgraph induced by the *knows* edges.
  Return the length of this path:

  * $-1$: no path found
  * $0$: start person = end person
  * $> 0$: path found (start person $\neq$ end person)
parameters:
  - name: person1Id
    type: ID

      In SNB Interactive v2.0, this query has two variants:

      `(b)` Guaranteed that there is no path between the two *Persons*

      `(b)` Guaranteed that there is a 4-hop path between the two *Persons*
  - name: person2Id
    type: ID
result:
  - name: shortestPathLength
    type: 32-bit Integer
    category: calculated
choke_points: [3.3, 7.2, 7.3, 7.5, 7.8, 8.1, 8.6]

  This query looks for a variable length path, starting at a given *Person* and finishing at an another given *Person*. Proper cardinality estimation and search space pruning, will be crucial. This query also allows for possible parallel implementations.
