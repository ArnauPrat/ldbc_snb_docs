title: Single shortest path
description: |
  Given two *Persons*, find the shortest path between these two *Persons* in the subgraph induced by the *knows* relationships.
  Return the length of this path:

  * $-1$: no path found
  * $0$: start person = end person
  * $> 0$: regular case
parameters:
  - name: person1.id
    type: ID
    description: "`person1Id`"
  - name: person2.id
    type: ID
    description: "`person2Id`"
result:
  - name: shortestPathLength
    type: 32-bit Integer
    category: calculated
choke_points: [3.3, 7.2, 7.3, 8.1, 8.6]

  This query looks for a variable length path, starting at a given *Person* and finishing at an another given *Person*. Proper cardinality estimation and search space prunning, will be crucial. This query also allows for possible parallel implementations.
