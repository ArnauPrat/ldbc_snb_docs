  Given a `$datetime`, find all *Messages* created before that moment.
  Group them by a 3-level grouping\:

  1. by year of creation
  2. for each year, group into *Message* types: is *Comment* or not
  3. for each year-type group, split into four groups based on length of their content
      * `0`: $0 \leq \text{length} < 40$ (short)
      * `1`: $40 \leq \text{length} < 80$ (one liner)
      * `2`: $80 \leq \text{length} < 160$ (tweet)
      * `3`: $160 \leq \text{length}$ (long)

parameters:
  - name: datetime
    type: DateTime

      For later microbatches, later `datetime` parameters are selected keep the variance low (<0.5%)
