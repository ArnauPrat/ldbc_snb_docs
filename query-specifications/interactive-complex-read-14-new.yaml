  **This query is used in the new version of SNB Interactive (v2.0+).**

  Find a cheapest path between two given *Persons* with IDs `$person1Id` and `$person2Id` in the interaction subgraph. If there are multiple cheapest paths, any of them can be returned. Do not return any rows if there is no path between the *Persons*.

  The interaction subgraph is based on a projection of the *Person*-*knows*-*Person* graph. In this projection, only those *knows* edges are kept whose endpoint *Persons* have at least one interaction between them.

  An interaction is defined as a direct reply *Comment* (by one of the *Persons*) to a *Message* (by the other *Person*). The weights are defined as:
  $\max(\mathrm{round}( 40 - \sqrt{\textit{numInteractions}} ), 1)$

  **Note:** Interactions are counted both ways, e.g. if Alice *knows* Bob, Alice writes 2 reply *Comments* to Bob's *Messages*
  and Bob writes 3 reply *Comments* to Alice's *Messages*, their total number of interactions is 5 and the weight of the knows edge is 38.

  **Remark:** Determinism is ensured by using square root followed by rounding.
  For all integers between 1 and $\numprint{100000}$, the square root's fractional part is more than 10e-5 from 0.5, where the rounding could be non-deterministic based on floating point inaccuracies. As 10e-5 is significantly larger than the machine epsilon of IEEE 754 floats (both 32- and 64-bit), the floating point inaccuracies have no chance to affect the derived integer edge weights.
