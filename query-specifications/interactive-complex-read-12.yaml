  Given a start *Person*, find the *Comments* that this *Person*'s friends made in reply to *Posts*, considering only those *Comments* that are direct (single-hop) replies to *Posts*, not the transitive (multi-hop) ones. Only consider *Posts* with a *Tag* in a given *TagClass* or in a descendent of that *TagClass*. Count the number of these reply *Comments*, and collect the *Tags* that were attached to the *Posts* they replied to, but only collect *Tags* with the given *TagClass* or with a descendant of that *TagClass*. Return *Persons* with at least one reply, the reply count, and the collection of *Tags*.

  This query starts at a *Person*, moves to its friends, and the to their *Comments* and their root *Posts*. Then, it gets the *Tag* of each *Post* and checks whether it (directly or transitively) belongs to the specified *TagClass*. This can be thought of a bidirectional search between the *Person* and the *TagClass*. The difficulty of this query is determining the optimal direction of this traversal.
