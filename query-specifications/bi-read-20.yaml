  Given a *Company* `company` and a *Person* `person2` (who is not working and has not worked at `company`), find a different *Person* (`person1`) who works or at some point worked in `company` and is reachable from `person2` through people who have studied together.
  On this path, we only consider edges between *Persons* who know each other and attended the same *University* and set the weight of the edge to the absolute difference between the year of enrolment plus 1 (`studyAt.classYear + 1`). If the *Persons* attended multiple universities, we select the smallest (`min`) value.
  
  If there are multiple *Person* `person1` nodes with the same shortest path, return all of them.
parameters:
  - name: company
    type: Long String

      *Companies* with a similar number of employees (former or current) are selected
  - name: person2Id
    type: ID
    description: |
      `person2` is selected so that there is a 2-hop path to a `person1` working at `company`

  Implementations can either pre-compute edge weights or compute them on-the-fly.

  To find the (weighted) shortest path efficiently, the system can use e.g. a bidirectional Dijkstra algorithm.
