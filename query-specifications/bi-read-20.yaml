description: |
  Given two *Companies* `company1` and `company2`, find pairs of *Persons* `person1` and `person2` with the shortest path through people who have pairwise studied together.
  On this path, we only consider edges between *Persons* who know each other and attended the same university and set the weight of the edge to the absolute difference between the year of enrolment `studyAt.studyYear` plus 1.
parameters:
  - name: company1
    type: Long String
  - name: company2
    type: Long String
result:
  - name: person1.id
    type: ID
  - name: person2.id
    type: ID
  - name: weight
    type: 32-bit Integer
    category: calculated
sort:
  - name: weight

  - name: person1.id

  Implementations can both pre-compute edge weights or compute them on-the-fly.
  To find a weighted shortest path efficiently, implementations can use e.g. a bidirectional Dijkstra algorithm.
