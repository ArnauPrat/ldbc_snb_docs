  Given two *Tag*/date pairs (`tagA`/`dateA` and `tagB`/`dateB`), for each pair `tagX`/`dateX`:

  * Create an induced subgraph between *Persons* where for each pair of *Persons* `person1`/`person2`, both have created a *Message* on the day of `dateX` with *Tag* `tagX`.
  * In the induced subgraph, only keep pairs of *Persons* who have at most `maxKnowsLimit` friends (in the induced subgraph).
  * For these *Persons*, count the number of *Messages* created on `dateX` with *Tag* `tagX`.
  
  Return *Persons* who had at least one *Messages* for both `tagA`/`dateA` and `tagB`/`dateB` ranked by their total number of *Messages* (descending).

  There are two major ways to compute this query:
  (1) create the induced subgraph as suggested by the specification (either as a view or in materialized form), or
  (2) skip creating the induced subgraph and perform on-the-fly check for the number of friends (who also posted at least one *Message* with the given *Tag* on the given date).
  The latter approach is easier to express in systems which do not provide graph views but might result in redundant computations (the query engine might repeatedly check whether a *Person* has at least one *Message* that satifies the conditions).
