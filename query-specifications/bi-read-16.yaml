  Given two *Tag*/day pairs (`tagA`/`dayA` and `tagB`/`dayB`), for each pair `tagX`/`dayX`:

  * Create an induced subgraph between *Persons* where for each pair of *Persons* `person1`/`person2`, both have created a *Message* on `dayX` with *Tag* `tagX`.
  * In the induced subgraph, only keep pairs of *Persons* who have at most `maxKnowsLimit` friends in the induced subraph.
  * In the resulting graph, add the number of *Messages* created by each *Person*, resulting in graph G.
  
  Compute the intersection of graphs G for `tagA`/`dayA` and `tagB`/`dayB`, return
