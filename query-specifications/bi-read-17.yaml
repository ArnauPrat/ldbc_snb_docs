title: Information propagation analysis
description: |
  This query aims to identify instances of "information propagation" when a *Person* (`person1`) submits a *Message* (`message1`) with a given *Tag* (`tag`) to a *Forum* (`forum1`).
  This is read by other members of `forum1`, *Persons* `person2` and `person3`.
  Some time later (specified by the `delta` parameter), these persons have a discussion with the same `tag` in a different *Forum* (`forum2`) where `person1` is not a member.
  The discussion consists of a *Message* (`message2`) by `person2` and a direct reply *Comment* (`comment`) by `person3`.
