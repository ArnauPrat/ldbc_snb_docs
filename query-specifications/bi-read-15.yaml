title: Trusted connection paths through forums created in a given timeframe
description: |
  Given two *Persons*, calculate the cost of the weighted shortest path between these two *Persons*, in the subgraph induced by the *knows* relationship.

  The weight of a *knows* edge is calculated based on the interactions of its *Person* endpoints:

  * Every direct reply (by one of the *Persons*) to a *Post* (by the other *Person*) contributes 1.0.
  * Every direct reply (by one of the *Persons*) to a *Comment* (by the other *Person*) contributes 0.5.

  Only consider *Messages* that were created in a *Forum* that was created within the timeframe (interval) `[startDate, endDate]`. Note that for *Comments*, the containing *Forum* is that of the *Post* that the comment (transitively) replies to. Also note that interactions are counted both ways.

  Return the cost of the weighted shortest path.
