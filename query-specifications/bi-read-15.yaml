title: Trusted connection paths through forums created in a given timeframe
description: |
  Given two *Persons* with IDs `$person1Id` and `$person2Id`, calculate the cost of the weighted shortest path between these two *Persons*, in the subgraph induced by the *knows* relationship. The interaction score of a *knows* edge is calculated based on the interactions of its *Person* endpoints:

  * Every direct reply (by one of the *Persons*) to a *Post* (by the other *Person*) is 1.0 point.
  * Every direct reply (by one of the *Persons*) to a *Comment* (by the other *Person*) is 0.5 points.

  Only consider *Messages* that were created in a *Forum* that was created within the timeframe (interval) `[$startDate, $endDate]`. Note that for *Comments*, the containing *Forum* is that of the *Post* that the comment (transitively) replies to. Also note that interactions are counted both ways.

  The weight for the shortest path algorithm is determined as $\frac{1}{\textit{interaction score} + 1}$.

  The result of the query is a single number, the cost of the weighted shortest path. If no such path exists, the query should return $-1.0$.
