  * Removal of a *Person* removes *Forums* of type "Walls" and "Albums" but not "Groups", which can continue if even the founder has left the network. For Groups, the *hasModerator* edge is deleted. We have discussed various approaches to appoint a new moderator, e.g.
    1. choose member at random from the set of existing group members or
    2. the member with the oldest group join date becomes the moderator.
  However, to keep the generator and the workload simple, currently no moderator is selected, leaving the group without a moderator.
  * Removal of a *Person* removes all *Posts*/*Comments* they are creator of this could result in the removal of a *Comment* in the middle of a thread.
