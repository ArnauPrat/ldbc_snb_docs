  * Removal of a person can (1) remove all associated posts/comments/forum nodes or (2) just the person node. GDPR is a valid argument for (1). Approach (2) could lead to problems with read queries, driver gathering parameters for short reads and inadvertently impose implementation decisions for implementors.
  * Removal of a person removes forums of type "personal walls" and "image albums" not "groups", which can continue if even the founder has left the network. The hasModerator edge must transition to an existing person node in the network, two approaches to assigning a new moderator were discussed: (1) choose member at random from the set of existing group members or (2) the member with the oldest group join date becomes the moderator.
  * Removal of a person removes all posts/comments they are creator of this could result in the removal of a comment in the middle of a thread.
