title: Zombies in a country
description: |
  Find zombies within the given `country`, and return their zombie scores. A `zombie` is a *Person* created before the given `endDate`, which has created an average of `[0, 1)` *Messages* per month, during the time range between profile's `creationDate` and the given `endDate`. The number of months spans the time range from the `creationDate` of the profile to the `endDate` with partial months on both end counting as one month (e.g. a `creationDate` of Jan 31 and an `endDate` of Mar 1 result in 3 months).

  For each `zombie`, calculate the following\:

  * `zombieLikeCount`: the number of *likes* received from other zombies.
  * `totalLikeCount`: the total number of *likes* received.
  * `zombieScore`: `zombieLikeCount` / `totalLikeCount`. If the value of `totalLikeCount` is 0, the `zombieScore` of the `zombie` should be 0.0.

  For both `zombieLikeCount` and `totalLikeCount`, only consider *likes* received from profiles that were created before the given `endDate`.
