  This query looks for paths of length two, starting from a given *Person*, going through its created *Messages* and finishing at their replies. In this query there is temporal locality between the replies being accessed. Thus the top-k order by this can interact with the selection, i.e. do not consider older *Posts* than the 20th oldest seen so far.
