title: Central person for a tag
description: |
  Given a *Tag*, find all *Persons* that are interested in the *Tag* and/or have written a *Message* (*Post* or *Comment*) with a `creationDate` after a given `date` and that has a given *Tag*. For each *Person*, compute the `score` as the sum of the
  following two aspects\:

  * 100, if the *Person* has this *Tag* as their interest, or 0 otherwise
  * number of *Messages* by this *Person* with the given *Tag*

  Also, for each *Person*, compute the sum of the score of the *Person*'s friends (`friendsScore`).

  Similarly to BI Q16, there are two major ways to compute this query:
  (1) creating an induced subgraph of the interested *Persons* and their friends and performing the scoring on this graph or
  (2) performing the scoring without creating an induced subgraph and scoring the friends of a *Person* on-the-fly.
  The latter approach is easier to express in systems which do not provide graph views but might result in redundant computations.
