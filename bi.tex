\chapter{Business Intelligence Workload}
\label{sec:bi}

The draft BI workload was published at the \mbox{GRADES-NDA} workshop at \mbox{SIGMOD 2018}~\cite{DBLP:conf/grades/SzarnyasPAMPKEB18}.
Version 1.0 of the workload is currently being prepared.

The LDBC SNB BI workload consists of two sets of operations:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Read queries.} Complex read queries touching a significant portion of the data. See \autoref{sec:bi-reads}.
\item \textbf{Microbatches of refresh operations.} A set of insert and delete operations, batched for a given time period (\eg an hour, a day, \etc). See \autoref{sec:bi-refreshes}.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Inserts}
\label{sec:bi-inserts}

See \emph{Interactive Inserts} (\autoref{sec:interactive-inserts}).

\subsection{Deletes}
\label{sec:bi-deletes}

Each delete query removes

\begin{enumerate}
    \item a single edge between two existing nodes
    \item or a node, all incident edges and, in certain cases, nodes and edges that are transitively reachable on a certain path.
\end{enumerate}
