\subsection{Forum}
\label{sec:forum}
\label{sec:hasModerator}

A \tForum is a meeting point where people post \tMessages.
There exists three categories of \tForums:
Wall ($\eForum_\textsf{w}$),
Album ($\eForum_\textsf{a}$),
and Group ($\eForum_\textsf{g}$).
Each \tForum has a set of \tPersons connected via \tHasMember edges, a set of \tTags connected via \tHasTag edges, a single moderator connected by a \tHasModerator edge and a set of \tMessages (discussed in Section \ref{sec:message}).
For all \tForums the outgoing \tHasTag edges get their creation date and deletion date from $\varc{\eForum}$ and $\vard{\eForum}$, respectively.

\subsubsection{Groups}
Groups are public places for people that share interests, any \tPerson can create a Group $\eForum_\textsf{g}$ during their lifespan. A Group can be deleted anytime after it was created.
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\varc{\eForum}_{\mathsf{g}} \in \interval{\varc{\ePerson} + \Delta}{\min (\vard{\ePerson}, \xSE)}$
    \item $\vard{\eForum}_{\mathsf{g}} \in \interval{\varc{\eForum}_{\mathsf{g}} + \Delta}{\xNC}$
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Group Moderator}
The initial \tHasModerator $\eHasModerator_{\mathsf{g}}$ is the Group creator. If the moderator leaves the Group, the Group will have no moderator (this is allowed in the schema of version 0.4.0+, see \autoref{fig:schema}).
\begin{itemize}
\item $\varc{\eHasModerator}_{\mathsf{g}} \in \interval{\varc{\eForum}_{\mathsf{g}} + \Delta}{\min (\vard{\eForum}_{\mathsf{g}}, \vard{\ePerson}, \xSE)}$
\item $\vard{\eHasModerator}_{\mathsf{g}} \in \interval{ \varc{\eHasModerator}_{\mathsf{g}} + \Delta}{\min (\vard{\eForum}_{\mathsf{g}}, \vard{\ePerson})}$
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Group Membership}
Any \tPerson $\ePerson$ can become a member of a given group. The \tHasMember $\eHasMember_{\mathsf{g}}$ creation is generated from the interval in which the \tPerson and \tForum lifespans overlap. The deletion date is generated from the interval between the membership creation date (incremented by $\Delta$) and the minimum of the \tPerson and \tForum deletion dates.
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\varc{\eHasMember}_{\mathsf{g}} \in \interval{\max ( \varc{\eForum}_{\mathsf{g}}, \varc{\ePerson}) + \Delta}{\min (\vard{\eForum}, \vard{\ePerson}, \xSE)} $
    \item $\vard{\eHasMember}_{\mathsf{g}} \in \interval{\varc{\eHasMember}_{\mathsf{g}} + \Delta}{\min (\vard{\eForum}_{\mathsf{g}}, \vard{\ePerson})}$
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Walls}
Every \tPerson $\ePerson$, has a Wall $\eForum_\textsf{w}$ which is created when the \tPerson joins the social network. The wall is deleted when the \tPerson is deleted.
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\varc{\eForum}_{\mathsf{w}} = \varc{\ePerson} + \Delta$
    \item $\vard{\eForum}_{\mathsf{w}} = \vard{\ePerson}$
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Wall Moderator}
Each \tPerson has a \tHasModerator $\eHasModerator_{\mathsf{w}}$ edge to their wall, which gets the creation date (incremented by $\Delta$) and deletion date from $\eForum_\textsf{w}$.
Note, only the moderator can create \tPost nodes on the wall and the connecting \tTag nodes are set based on the interest of the moderator.
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\varc{\eHasModerator}_{\mathsf{w}} = \varc{\eForum}_{\mathsf{w}} + \Delta$
    \item $\vard{\eHasModerator}_{\mathsf{w}} = \vard{\eForum}_{\mathsf{w}}$
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Wall Membership}
For a \tPerson $p_i$, all their friends $p_j$ (\tPerson nodes connected via a \tKnows edge) become members of $\eForum_\textsf{w}$ at the time the \tKnows edge is created. Hence, a \tHasMember $\eHasMember_{\mathsf{w}}$ edge gets the creation date of \tKnows incremented by $\Delta$. The deletion date is derived from the minimum of the \tForum deletion date and \tKnows deletion date.
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\varc{\eHasMember}_{\mathsf{w}} = \varc{\eKnows_{i,j}} + \Delta$
    \item $\vard{\eHasMember}_{\mathsf{w}} = \min(\vard{\eForum}_{\mathsf{w}}, \vard{\eKnows_{i,j}})$
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Albums}
A \tPerson can create multiple Albums ($\eForum_\textsf{a}$) containing a set of \tPhotos{}. Albums can be created and then deleted at any point during the lifespan of the \tPerson.
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\varc{\eForum}_\textsf{a} \in \interval{\varc{\ePerson} + \Delta}{\min (\vard{\ePerson}, \xSE)}$
    \item $\vard{\eForum}_\textsf{a} \in \interval{ \varc{\eForum}_\textsf{a} + \Delta}{\vard{\ePerson}}$
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Album Moderator}
The \tPerson is the moderator for any Album they create. Album ownership cannot change hence \tHasModerator $\eHasModerator_{\mathsf{a}}$ gets the creation date (incremented by $\Delta$) and deletion date from $\varc{\eForum}_\textsf{a}$ and $\vard{\eForum}_\textsf{a}$ respectively.
\begin{itemize}
\item $\varc{\eHasModerator}_{\mathsf{a}} = \varc{\eForum}_{\mathsf{a}} + \Delta$
\item $\vard{\eHasModerator}_{\mathsf{a}} = \vard{\eForum}_{\mathsf{a}}$
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Album Membership}
Only friends $\ePerson_i$ of a \tPerson $\ePerson_j$ can become members of Albums created by $\ePerson_j$. The \tHasMember $\eHasMember_{\mathsf{a}}$ edge creation date is derived from the Album and $\type{knows}$ creation dates. The deletion is derived from the $\type{Forum}$ and $\type{knows}$ deletion dates.
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\varc{\eHasMember}_\textsf{a} = \max ( \varc{\eForum}_\textsf{a}, \varc{\eKnows}_{i,j} ) + \Delta $
    \item $\vard{\eHasMember}_{\mathsf{w}} = \min ( \vard{\eForum}_\textsf{a}, \vard{\eKnows}_{i,j} ) $
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Message}
\label{sec:message}

A \tMessage is an abstract entity that represents a message created by a \tPerson.
There are two \tMessage subtypes: \tPost and \tComment.
A \tPost is created in a \tForum and a \tComment represents a comment made by a \tPerson to an existing \tMessage (either a \tPost or a \tComment).
In a \tForum the set of \tMessage nodes form a \emph{tree} with a \tPost node at the root and \tComment nodes for the rest.

\subsubsection{Post}

A \tPost can be created by a \tPerson in a \tForum.
Only the moderator (\ie owner) can post on a Wall or in an Album (\tHasModerator),
whereas all members including the moderator (\tHasMember/\tHasModerator) can post in a Group.
These relationships are captured with the $\eHasMember$ variable in the formulas.
\tPosts are divided in three categories, \emph{regular posts}, \emph{photos}, and \emph{flashmob posts}.

\paragraph{Regular Posts and Photos}

Regular posts capture the standard daily activity in a Group or on a Wall.
Photos are created in Albums. (Interaction with Photos is limited to \tLikes, see details in \autoref{sec:likes}). The creation date for these is determined as follows:
$$\varc{\ePost} \in \interval{\varc{\eHasMember} + \Delta}{\min (\vard{\eHasMember}, \xSE) }$$

\paragraph{Flashmob Posts}

Flashmob posts are generated around events that attract significant interest
(such as elections) that result in a spike in activity.
These events span a $2\phi$-hour time window centered around a specific event time, flashmob event $\eFlashmobEvent$, in the middle of the window; there are $\phi$ hours each side of the specific event time.
$$
\varc{\ePost} \in \interval{\max(\varc{\eHasMember} + \Delta,\eFlashmobEvent - \phi\textrm{\,h})}{\min (\vard{\eHasMember},\eFlashmobEvent + \phi\textrm{\,h},\xSE)}
$$

The deletion dates for all categories of \tPosts are determined as:
$$\vard{\ePost} \in \interval{\varc{\ePost} + \Delta}{\vard{\eHasMember}}$$

\paragraph{containerOf edge}

Each \tPost node has an incoming $\type{containerOf}$ edge which gets the same lifespan attributes as the \tPost.

\subsubsection{Comment}

A \tComment $\eComment$ is created by \tPerson $\ePerson$ as a reply to \tMessage $\eMessage$. \tComments are only made in Walls and Groups. \tComment always occur within $\gamma$~days of their parent message following a power-law distribution with mean 6.85 hours.

\begin{itemize}
    \item $\varc{\eComment} \in \interval{\max (\varc{\eMessage}, \varc{\eHasMember}) + \Delta}{\min (\varc{\eMessage} + \gamma\textrm{\,d}, \vard{\eHasMember}, \xSE)}$
    \item $\vard{\eComment} \in \interval{\varc{\eComment} + \Delta}{\min (\vard{\eMessage}, \vard{\eHasMember})}$
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{replyOf edge}

\tComments always have an outgoing \tReplyOf edge with containment semantics, \ie the target \tMessage contains the \tComment. These edges get the same lifespan as their source \tComment.

\subsubsection{likes}
\label{sec:likes}

A \tLikes edge $\eLikes$ can exist between \tPerson $\ePerson$ and \tMessage $\eMessage$. Messages can only receive likes during a $\mu$-day window after their creation at which point no more activity is generated.

\begin{itemize}
    \item $\varc{\eLikes} \in \interval{\max(\varc{\ePerson}, \varc{\eMessage}) + \Delta}{\min (\vard{\ePerson}, \vard{\eMessage}, \varc{\eMessage} + \mu\textrm{\,d}, \xSE)}$
    \item $\vard{\eLikes} \in \interval{\varc{\eLikes} + \Delta}{\min (\vard{\ePerson}, \vard{\eMessage})}$
\end{itemize}
