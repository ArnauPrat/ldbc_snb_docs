\paragraph*{Graph processing benchmarks.}

Recent graph benchmarking initiatives focus on three key areas:

\begin{enumerate}
\item transactional workloads consisting of interactive read and update queries (OLTP) aiming at graph databases that explore small portions of the graph in each query~\cite{DBLP:conf/cidr/BarahmandG13,DBLP:conf/sigmod/ArmstrongPBC13,DBLP:journals/ase/DayarathnaS14,DBLP:conf/sigmod/ErlingALCGPPB15,DBLP:journals/pvldb/LissandriniBV18},
\item graph analysis algorithms (\eg PageRank) computed in bulk, typically expressed in cluster frameworks with graph APIs, rather than high-level queries~\cite{DBLP:conf/hipc/BaderM05,DBLP:conf/bigdataconf/ElserM13,DBLP:conf/sc/NaiXTKL15,DBLP:journals/pvldb/IosupHNHPMCCSAT16},
\item pattern matching and inferencing on semantic data~\cite{DBLP:journals/ws/GuoPH05,DBLP:books/sp/virgilio09/SchmidtHMPL09,DBLP:conf/semweb/MorseyLAN11,DBLP:conf/semweb/AlucHOD14,DBLP:journals/sosym/SzarnyasIRV18}.
\end{enumerate}

The challenges of using benchmarks correctly are described in~\cite{DBLP:conf/sigmod/RaasveldtHGM18}.

The Interactive queries were used in paper~\cite{DBLP:conf/grades/PacaciZLO17} to compare the performance of Gremlin, Cypher, SQL and SPARQL query engines.

%\section{Scalable Graph Generators}

%The \datagen component of SNB is a fork of the generator described in~\cite{DBLP:conf/tpctc/PhamBE12}.

\paragraph*{LDBC publications.}

A detailed list of LDBC publications is curated at~\url{http://ldbcouncil.org/publications}.

\paragraph{Recent advancements.}

\emph{An approach to generate deletions in Datagen was presented at the GRADES-NDA~2020 workshop~\cite{DBLP:conf/sigmod/WaudbySPS20}.}

\emph{An ACID test suite was recently accepted at the TPCTC~2020 conference~\cite{tpctc_acid}.}

\emph{We have recently revised the auditing guildelines based on the EU project deliverable D6.3.3 ``LDBC Benchmark Auditing Policies''~\cite{LdbcAuditingPoliciesDeliverable}.}

\emph{These documents will be incorporated in the specification by September 2020.}
